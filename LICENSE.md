### 6. Regulatory Classification & AI Risk Acknowledgment
The user acknowledges and agrees to the following regarding the **EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689)**:

- **Nature of the System**: The Software utilizes general-purpose AI models (e.g., YOLO, YuNet) for object and biometric detection solely for the purpose of **de-identification** and **pseudonymization**.
- **Biometric Categorization Warning**: The Software includes capabilities that may allow the inference of attributes (e.g., detecting minors or public figures). The user acknowledges that enabling or using features for **biometric categorization** or **identification** may reclassify the system as **"High-Risk"** under **Annex III** of the AI Act. The user assumes full responsibility for any resulting obligations, including Conformity Assessments and Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments (FRIA).
- **Human Oversight (Article 14)**: The Software is designed to function with a **"Human-in-the-Loop"**. It is strictly prohibited to use the Software in a fully autonomous mode for legal decision-making. The user must utilize the provided "Review & Audit" interfaces to validate all AI suggestions before applying them.
- **Transparency (Article 50)**: The user is responsible for fulfilling transparency obligations, such as informing individuals that their data is being processed by an AI system, even if for anonymization purposes.
- **Accuracy & Hallucinations**: The user accepts that AI models are probabilistic and may produce **False Positives** (unnecessary blurring) or **False Negatives** (failure to anonymize). The author is not liable for data breaches resulting from AI detection failures.

### 7. Termination
This license will terminate automatically if any of the conditions herein are breached. In such cases, the user must immediately cease using the Software and delete all copies in their possession.

### 8. Transparency and Decision Logging
